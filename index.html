    <!--This page will contain information about what passwords do, how to make a good password, how to keep a password secure, and why MFA is critical to authentication.
    --!>

    Passwords are the most basic form of authentication. They work because you
    and whoever you are trying to authorize with knows it; but no one else does. This is why
    it is critical to not share the password with others.
    <div class="tip">Do not re-use passwords.</div>

    Humans are extremely predictable.
    Therefore a secure password is required. A password generator like the ones found
    in password managers can provide good random passwords. Passwords also need to have high entropy.
    Take this example: You can make a password that is between 4 and 12 letters but can only include
    the character "1". A valid password would look like this: "111111". That does not look secure,
    and it is not! Because there are only 9 possible passwords.
  
    <div class="tip">Use a password generator.</div>

  In basically every Modern OS the best antivirus is common sense. A good ad blocker will prevent you from clicking on fake download buttons
  and common sense will say to only run software you trust, especially as administrator. If you get a virus or have strange behavior then
  cleanly reinstall your OS and restore your files from your backup.
